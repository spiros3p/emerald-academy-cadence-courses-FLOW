# Chapter 1 - Day 1 

### 1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words.
A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger that is shared among the nodes of a network of computers. A blockchain's innovation is that it guarantess the security of data and being trustless.


### 2. Explain what a Smart Contract is
A smart contract is code stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They define methods (functions) and data that will be stored on the blockchain and determine how transactions can alter their data.


### 3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction

- **Script**    
A script is used to View (Query) data on the blockchain, it does not mutate data and it does not cost gas.

- **Transaction**    
A transaction is used to mutate (edit/change) data on the blockchain, it costs gas and the amount of gas needed is dependent on the complexity of the calculations executed by the smart contract code.
