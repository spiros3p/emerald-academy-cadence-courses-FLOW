# Chapter 1 - Day 1

1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

- Safety & Security
- Clarity
- Approachability
- Developer Experience
- Resource Oriented Programming

2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful?

Being secure is (or should be) every coding language's core obligation. Also, being strong typed, especially for new languages is a huge plus (in my opinion) as it forces the developer to have a better understanding of the code. 
Clarity allows anyone to read and understand the code of a smart contract and also review a transaction's code before executing it.
Cadence, indeed, for me personally, having experience with mainly javascript seems very approachable and got me hooked to learn and code my first smart contract (on any blockchain) with it.
I do not have enough experience yet, with error messages in cadence, hope


Cadence was designed to solve issues of an existing smart contract language (Solidity).
