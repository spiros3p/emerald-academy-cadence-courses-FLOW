# Chapter 2 - Day 2 

1. Explain why we wouldn't call changeGreeting in a script.     

We would not call the changeGreeting method in a script, because 
the method is mutating data on the blockchain and could be called 
only from a transaction, in order to be executed.

2. What does the AuthAccount mean in the prepare phase of the transaction?

AuthAccount in the prepare part of the trx means access to the data of that account.

3. What is the difference between the prepare phase and the execute phase in the transaction?

Prepare phase is the only phase that there is access to the data of the signing account.
